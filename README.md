# Research_Segmentation_of_Leaves_From_Background_Images_Using_Double_UNet_Plus_Architecture

Using Computer Vision, VGG16, ResNet101V2, EfficientNetV2B3<br/>
<ol>
<li>I was focusing on detecting Rumex leaves using advanced computer vision techniques. My research employs
double-UNet architecture to segment Rumex leaves from diverse backgrounds.</li>
<li>I evaluated several neural network models within the Double-UNetPlus architecture, including VGG16,
ResNet101V2, EfficientNetV2B3, and five additional architectures, using Python for implementation.</li>
<li>ResNet101V2 outperformed the others, showcasing its superior accuracy and robustness in detecting Rumex leaves.</li>
